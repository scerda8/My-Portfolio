### User Story:

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples

SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position



### Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer

WHEN I load the portfolio

THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer

WHEN I view the header

THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio

WHEN I view the navigation titles

THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted

WHEN I click on a navigation title

THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
